# Much of what starting a project looks like is trial-and-error. 
# Testing out some API, or some functionality, or whatever.
# The playground is intended as a temporary file where you can conduct such experiments
# An alternative is to use a Jupyter notebook (playground.ipynb), which is
# ideal for interactive experimentation.
